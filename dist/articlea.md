**Python Functions**
Python functions are blocks of code that can be reused multiple times. A function is defined using the def keyword, followed by the function name and a set of parentheses. The code inside the function is executed when the function is called.



For example, the following code defines a function called greet that prints a message

```
def greet(name):
	print(f"Hello, {name}")
	
greet("John")
```

When the code is run, it will print "Hello, John".
